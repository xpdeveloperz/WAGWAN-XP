WAGWAN-XP is a WhatsApp MD bot built on top of the **Baileys** library.  
It’s designed to be fast, lightweight, and easy to customize without touching the core code.  
This project is **fully open source** — you can modify it, rebrand it, and make your **own bot** from this codebase **free of cost**, without needing any permission from our side.  
All commands and the overall structure are written in a way that makes customization (bot image, prefix, name, features, etc.) as easy as possible.

---

## ✨ Features

- **Fully Open Source** – entire codebase is editable; host it anywhere (Heroku, panel, VPS, etc.).
- **Easy Customization via Commands** – change **bot image**, **prefix**, **channel/newsletter**, **bot name**, etc. with simple commands.
- **Modular Command System** – commands are organized in the `commands` folder for easy editing.
- **Optimized for Stability** – RAM‑optimized media handling (streaming, temp cleanup), better session handling via `sessionID` in `config.js`.
- **Owner Utilities** – restart, update from ZIP, and more owner‑only tools.

> This creates your own copy of `Knightbot-Mini` under your GitHub account.

### 2. Get Pair Code

Deploy a small helper to generate a **pair code** and obtain your session string.

</a>

</div>

After scanning, you will receive a **session string** starting with:

```text
WAGWAN-XP....
```

Copy that full string and paste it into `config.js`:

```js
sessionID: "WAGWAN-XP.....";
```

Or set it via the `SESSION_ID` environment variable when hosting.

### 3. Deploy on Panel (Katabump, etc.)

## 🛠 Local Setup

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mruniquehacker/WAGWAN-XP.git
cd WAGWAN-XP
```

### 2️⃣ Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3️⃣ Configure session

Edit `config.js`:

- **Option A: Use session string**

  ```js
  sessionID: "WAGWAN-XP.....";
  ```

- **Option B: Scan QR**

  ```js
  sessionID: "";
  ```

  Run the bot and scan the QR from the terminal.

### 4️⃣ Run the bot

```bash
node index.js

When the bot starts:

- If `sessionID` is empty, a **QR code** will appear in the terminal – scan it using **Linked Devices** in WhatsApp.
- If `sessionID` is set, it will log in using that session string.
